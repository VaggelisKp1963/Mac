# Software I/II – C++ Project

This repository contains a C++ coursework project developed for Software I & II.

## Overview

The project demonstrates structured programming and modular design in C++.  
It includes multiple source files and header files, focusing on clean code organization and file-based input handling.

## Features

- Modular implementation using multiple `.cpp` and `.h` files
- File input processing
- Structured logic and separation of functionality
- Use of standard C++ libraries (STL)

## How to Compile

Using g++:

```bash
g++ test.cpp test-functions.cpp -o program
HOW TO RUN 
./program
